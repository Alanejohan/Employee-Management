# Employee-Management

basically we are going to work based on the sidebar menu and following this website as reference: https://smarthr-ci.dreamguystech.com/template/dark/public/holidays
I have already done the admin and employee dashboard. added to that, i did all the pages under the apps section. so right now we are working on the other sections. 

You can browse other pages inside the pages folder for inpiration and components that can be used to make the work faster 

in case you want to add a modal or an alert they are already in the all-employees file.


enjoy!!!!
